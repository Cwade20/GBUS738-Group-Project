# Project Proposal
In the cricket industry, there is a large pool of talent representing many different teams. During the end of seasons, players with open contract can be traded to opposing teams, or their contracts re-evaluated for their existing teams. Understanding a players net worth is extremely important for not only team managers who are working to ensure team victories, but also important for not only team managers who are working to ensure team victories, but also important for team investors who are stakeholders placing monetary inputs to ensure the best chance of success.
Our team will be analyzing players statistics during the seasons, over many years to develop an accurate model which can be best predict a players net worth, and thereby predict which players should be invested in more heavily by stakeholders. Based on our analysis we will be able to effectively measure the success of players and predict future performance.
